# Netlify Skills

This project deploys on Netlify. Use these skills for guidance on Netlify platform primitives. Each skill provides specific, factual reference for working with a Netlify feature.

## When to Use Each Skill

**Building API endpoints or server-side logic?**
Read `netlify-functions/SKILL.md` for modern function syntax, routing, background/scheduled functions.

**Need low-latency middleware, geo-based logic, or request manipulation?**
Read `netlify-edge-functions/SKILL.md` for edge compute patterns.

**Storing files, images, or simple key-value data?**
Read `netlify-blobs/SKILL.md` for object storage API.

**Need a relational database?**
Read `netlify-db/SKILL.md` for Neon Postgres setup, Drizzle ORM, and migrations. It also covers when Blobs is a better fit.

**Optimizing or transforming images?**
Read `netlify-image-cdn/SKILL.md` for the image transformation endpoint and clean URL patterns. For user-uploaded images, see `netlify-image-cdn/references/user-uploads.md`.

**Adding HTML forms?**
Read `netlify-forms/SKILL.md` for form detection, AJAX submissions, spam filtering, and file uploads.

**Configuring netlify.toml (redirects, headers, build settings)?**
Read `netlify-config/SKILL.md` for the complete configuration reference.

**Deploying, managing env vars, or running local dev?**
Read `netlify-cli-and-deploy/SKILL.md` for CLI commands, Git vs manual deploys, and environment variable management.

**Setting up a framework (Vite, Astro, TanStack, Next.js)?**
Read `netlify-frameworks/SKILL.md` for adapter/plugin setup. Framework-specific details are in `netlify-frameworks/references/`.

**Controlling CDN caching behavior?**
Read `netlify-caching/SKILL.md` for cache headers, stale-while-revalidate, cache tags, and purge.

**Adding AI capabilities?**
Read `netlify-ai-gateway/SKILL.md` for AI Gateway setup with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google SDKs.

## General Rules

- Use `Netlify.env.get("VAR")` for environment variables in functions (not `process.env`)
- Never hardcode secrets — use Netlify environment variables
- Add `.netlify` to `.gitignore`
- For framework-specific patterns, check the framework reference before writing custom Netlify Functions — the adapter may handle it
